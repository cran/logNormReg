=============
version 0.5-0  (2021-11-08)
=============
* summary and print.summary return the (pseudo) R2 based on the log values
* two datasets (palermo and paris) included 


=============
version 0.4-0  (2021-10-12)
=============
* lognlm(.., lik=FALSE) accepts argument 'weights' (thanks to Vito Ilacqua (Env Prot Ag) for his input). 'lik=FALSE' is the default now. 
* changes in vcov.lognlm: argument 'sandw' removed (it is always TRUE) and new argument 'exH' added.
* if lik=FALSE the dispersion parameter is estimated taking n-p rather then n in the denominator.
* type='gradient' in confint.lognlm() is allowed even for non-likelihood fits obtained via lik=FALSE.
* extractAIC() optionally can return the BIC (by setting k<=0).


=============
version 0.3-0  (2019-10-15)
=============
* Function extractAIC.lognlm() introduced: drop1(), step() and friends are allowed (thanks to Ralph Pirow (German Federal Inst. Risk Assessment) for suggestion) 
* bug fixed: logLik.lognlm() did not return the attributes "edf" and "nobs" 


=============
version 0.2-0  (2018-10-08) 
=============
* Method confint.lognlm introduced to compute confidence intervals via the Wald the Likelihood Ratio or the Gradient statistics
* bug fixed: the offset term was not handled correctly in lognlm()


=============
version 0.1-0 (2018-07-02, not on CRAN)  
=============
* First public release on ResearchGate with functions:
lognlm, lognlm.fit, logLik.lognlm, print.lognlm, print.summary.lognlm, summary.lognlm, vcov.lognlm
